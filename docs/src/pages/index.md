## Quick start

1. [Sign up](https://www.canopyapi.co/signin?view=sign_up) for a new Canopy API account or [sign in](https://www.canopyapi.co/signin) if you're a regular.
1. After signing in copy paste your API key, you'll need this later. Remember not to share this key.
1. **Choose your API style**: Canopy API supports both GraphQL and REST endpoints:
   - **GraphQL**: Make requests to `https://graphql.canopyapi.co/` with a `POST` method
   - **REST**: Make requests to `https://rest.canopyapi.co/api/amazon/product` with a `GET` method
   - Both require an `API-KEY` header or `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` header
1. Check out our examples for more details integrating Canopy API with popular libraries and both GraphQL (GraphQL Yoga, Apollo Server, Hoppscotch) and REST (Python, JavaScript fetch) approaches.
